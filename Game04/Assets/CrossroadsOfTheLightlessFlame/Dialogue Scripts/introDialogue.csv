Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Oh, hello there. You look quite lost. Well, I don't blame you. It's quite dark around these parts."
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"'It is a bird that speaks, and yet, there is something familiar about it.'"
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"'You stare. He seems to take that in stride.'"
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"I am Erin. Some call me a guide, and others consider me a... general nuisance."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"There is no accounting for taste, apparently. I think it may be the glasses."
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"'You don't really have an opinion on Erin's glasses.'"
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Well, regardless of that, you give off the distinct air of someone who has no idea about where they are."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"And I'm not about to do the thing where I bury you under needless lore. It is rather... inelegant."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Indeed, I hear that learning by doing is much more effective. Two birds with a... ah. No, two mice ensnared at once."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Even if you only have one at your disposal now. Yes, that will do nicely."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Eyes are an asset, unless you have been clicking about in the dark thinking that mice are a pretty neat idea for a fidget toy."
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"'Erin is grinning. Birds having teeth is as weird as it sounds.'"
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Well, anyway. What comes ahead is mostly... physically damaging. Do you have anything to defend yourself with?"
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"'The Narrator does not enjoy the rhetorical nature of this conversation.'"
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Fair. Well, you do have a satchel of some sort on you. Quite gaudy, but I digress. I can offer you a... wing. A few wares."
Narrator,questionA,NONE,characterA,"'That just sounds like you are about to chop it off.'"
Erin,NONE,questionB,characterB,"Well, I have some things that may be useful to you. Take your pick of the two assortments."
